# finding-similar-movies-
- finding similar movies using machine learning (word embedding + PCA)
- In this notebook, I will quantify the similarity of movies based on their plot summaries available on IMDb and Wikipedia, then separate them into groups, also known as clusters. We'll create a dendrogram to represent how closely the movies are related to each other.
